        Answer 1: Difference between = and  ==?

        = is an assignment operator, assignment operators in programming are symbols used to assign values to variables. eg: int a=10;
        == it is a relational operator and is used to compare the values if both are equal or not.

        b = 1 byte
        long = 8 8 bytes , so total 8+1 = 9 bytes

        String s = "name" //8 bytes
